Description: The model processes the input data on a daily basis (or according to the time resolution) to include the following aspects:
   - Snow Accumulation and Melt: Calculations for snow-water-equivalent and snowmelt are conducted.
   - Evapotranspiration (ETP) and Interception: The model computes the system’s evapotranspirative demand using a coefficient-based approach, the Leaf Area Index, and interception-related parameters.
   - Soil Water Capacity and Balancing: It computes different stages of infiltration, soil moisture content, and storage.
   - Surface Runoff and Total Runoff: In addition to soil water processes, it also handles surface runoff.
